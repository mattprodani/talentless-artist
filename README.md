# talentless-artist

A Deep Learning network that generates images of paintings based on Van Gogh's style.

Trained on V100 GPUs using Google Colab Pro and the StyleGAN2 framework for PyTorch provided by NVidia.

Sample images generated are available in the repo as well as snapshots of the latest network pickle files

The ArtistGAN notebook contains instructions about how to recreate a similar model
